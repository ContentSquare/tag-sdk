## How to Use Contentsquare Tag

### Prerequisites

Before using the Contentsquare tag, make sure you have one of the following:

- **Contentsquare Account**: Client id is required (for enterprise accounts). To obtain a client id please visit the official website (https://www.contentsquare.com/).
- **CS Lite Account**: Site id is required for CS Lite accounts.

### Steps to Use Contentsquare Tag

Follow the steps below to use the Contentsquare tag on your website:

1. **Include the Contentsquare Script**: In your website's Javascript/Typescript, add the Contentsquare script using the provided client ID or site ID. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Contentsquare client ID, or `YOUR_CS_LITE_SITE_ID` with the CS Lite site ID.

   Call the `injectContentsquareScript` function with the necessary options to append the Contentsquare script to the document.head.

   ```javascript
   // Replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' with your actual Contentsquare client ID
   // Replace 'YOUR_CS_LITE_SITE_ID' with your actual CS Lite site ID
   injectContentsquareScript({
     clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     siteId: "YOUR_CS_LITE_SITE_ID", // Optional: only for CS Lite customers, if set do not pass the clientId
     async: true, // Optional: Set to false to wait for script execution until after document parsing.
     defer: false, // Optional: Set to true to defer script execution after document parsing.
     integrity: "YOUR_SCRIPT_INTEGRITY_HASH", // Optional: Provide the integrity hash for script security (if required).
   });
   ```

   The function will append the Contentsquare script to the document.head, and it will be fetched and executed accordingly based on the provided options.

2. **Usage**: Please refer to the [Contentsquare documentation](https://docs.contentsquare.com/uxa-en/) for more information on using the Contentsquare tag.
